# Werktek Design Examples

This is a mockup of the Wolfson 404 page. Consistent with the rest of the site, I tried to take elements patients would see walking around the hostpital, like the crayons, and implement them on the site.

This is the Wolfson donation form. I don't design movie posters and billboards but I do take content and make is visually appealing and presentable. I chose to share this because a lot of the ‘design’ work I do is about making hierarchical decisions. Often times I find myself needing to present a lot of information on one page and the challenge is usually to present the content in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the user. Below you’ll see a small screen view of the form that uses a simple JavaScript toggle to hide information until the user selects a checkbox indicating they need the extra form elements. Then they are displayed.

## Going Back in Time

We are going way back with this one, it's taken from a college project. The task was to take a CD cover and redesign it. I wish I could say we were all assigned the same cover but I willingly chose Taylor Swift. How embarrassing.

Similar to the CD, this assignment was to take a book jacket and redesign it. I suppose it was a book I was reading at the time.

Also a college project, I remember this being an element to introduce an art gallery that was featuring both American and Chinese artists.

In the past I've occasionally done some freelance work. In this case the client wanted to give each instructor at her studio customized t-shirts. I took images of all of the dancers and created silhouettes of them all to place on the front of each shirt.

I mentioned in my interview that my first job out of college was working for Scientific Games, the parent company of WMS and Bally slots. I coded their emails but also did some of the design for their Facebook advertisements. The following was a Facebook banner ad or something along those lines promoting the [new] KISS slots.
